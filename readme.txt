Add annotations to any part of a blog post. Livefyre Sidenotes allows bloggers and readers to annotate content in a simple, mobile-friendly interface you can moderate.

== Description ==

With Livefyre Sidenotes, your readers can engage directly with content — a quote, a paragraph, an image — anywhere on your blog posts, inspiring focused conversations and allowing readers to interact with and share your content as they read it.

Elevate the quality of conversations:
* Readers can choose precisely where to place each Sidenote, which is then surfaced directly beside the selected content. This gives readers a much more granular way to engage with content, resulting in more meaningful conversations. 
Make engagement easier: 
* Sidenotes enables readers to make a connection with a particular quote, phrase or image seen on the page, making it easy and fun for readers to capture reactions, insights and questions as they happen.

* Readers can share Sidenotes with their social networks on Facebook and Twitter, drawing more people into the conversation and onto your content.
Allow readers to engage with content, not just each other: 
* Because Sidenotes are contextual, users tend to keep the conversation focused on the content being annotated, rather than reactions to what others are saying. Sidenotes also makes it easier for you to clarify points and engage in debate around specific pieces of content with readers.

== FAQ ==

= What if I already have Livefyre Community Comments installed on my WordPress blog? =

Livefyre Sidenotes is a separate WordPress plugin from Livefyre Comments. If you already have Livefyre Comments on your site, you can install Sidenotes as well with your existing Livefyre Site ID. 

= Do Sidenotes count as comments that sync to the WordPress database? =
 
No. Sidenotes are connected to the content on the page, and do not sync with or replace WordPress’ default comments. Unlike Livefyre Comments, you will not see Sidenotes data go into your WordPress database.

= Are Sidenotes mobile friendly? =
 
Yes! Sidenotes can be created and read on all Android and iOS devices.

= What if I change the content a Sidenote is on? =
 
Sidenotes can be attached to paragraphs, images or specific words in a post. If you edit, modify or move that content, its Sidenotes will remain attached to it. If you delete the content altogether, you will also delete the Sidenotes attached to it.
 
= Is there someone I can contact if I’m seeing an issue? =
 
Sure! We recognize that many custom WordPress themes and configurations exist, so if seeing any issues while getting Sidenotes integrated onto yours, feel free to contact support@livefyre.com, and we’ll be happy to help.
